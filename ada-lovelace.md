# Ada Lovelace
Ada Lovelace was a English mathematician who lived from December 1815 to Novemeber 1852. Ada's family included her father poet Lord Byron, her mother Annabella Byron, and a couple half siblings. Ada Lovelace was considered the world's first computer programmer for writing the first algorithm, or program, intended to be carried out by a machine. Ada Lovelace was best known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer. In Ada's upbringing she was chiefly exercised in connection with her mechanical ingenuity. This was the best for Ada, a discipline for arithmetic, music, and French. This created her into 'A Female Genius'. Lovelace became interested in Babbage's machines as early as 1833, where she was introduced to Babbage by their mutual friend, author Mary Somerville. Babbage only built a small part of the Analytical Engine, but Lovelace's efforts have been remembered. And so the early programming language Ada was named for her, and the second Tuesday in October has become Ada Lovelace Day, on which the contributions of women to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics are honoured.
