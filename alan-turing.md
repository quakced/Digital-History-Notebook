# Alan Turing
Augusta Ada Lovelace is known as the first computer programmer, and, since 2009, she has been recognized annually for her contributions of women to math and science. Her work eventually inspire the thoughths of Alan Turing who helped deleop the first modern computers. Alan Turing
was born June 23, 1912, London, England and died June 7, 1954, Wilmslow, Cheshire. Turing was a British mathematician and logician who made major contributions to mathematics, cryptanalysis, logic, philosophy, and mathematical biology. Turning also worked in areas later called computer science, artifical intelligence, cognitive science, and artifical life. 
Turing was educated at a top private school and he entered the University of Cambridge to study mathematics in 1931. In 1936 Turing's seminal paper 'On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem (Decision Problem)' was recommened for publication by the American mathematical logician Alonzo Church. Turing and Church sought for an effective method for solving the fundamental mathemtical problems. The Entscheidungsproblem problem had no resolution. In Turnings others works he developed the Turing Machine, which was a hypothetical model of the general-purpose computer that showed how anyhting comutable could be computed by such a machine. Turning was also known for his World War II Codebreaking. Turing was instrumental in breaking the German Enigma code during World War II. These early contrubtions to early Computer Science gave him the name of Father of Computer Science.
