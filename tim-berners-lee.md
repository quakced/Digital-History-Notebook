# Tim Berners-Lee
Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989 while working at CERN. He delevoped the core technologies that are used in web development, this includes HTML, HTTP, and URLs. The web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientist in universities and institutes around the world. As you could probably guess he created thje first web browser and server. Tim had a vision for a global system of sharing information using hypertext and the internt. Tim on April 1993 put the World Wide Web software in public domain. CERN eventually released a opened WWW to open licence. On March 18 2013, Sir Tim and a couple other people were awarded the Queen Elizabeth Prize of Engineering for 'ground-breaking innovation in engineering that has been of global benefit to humanity.' These actions allowed the web to flourish.
